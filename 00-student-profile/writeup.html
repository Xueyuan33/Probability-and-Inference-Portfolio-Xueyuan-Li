Hi, Professor Hakmook. My name is Xueyuan Li. I am from China. 
I just graduated from Henan University in China this year and studied Data Science in Computer Science. 
I have learned some superficial probability principles and statistics in data analysis using Python. 
But I think I have forgotten almost all of them maybe. Additionally, I have not gotten in touch with R before. 
So, I just hope it is not hard to pick up the knowledge again and change it into R programming. 
By the way, my English is not very good and still needs to practice a lot. I will learn more solidly and rigorously. 
About the artists I like must be the group of Blackpink, which is one of the most popular k-pop girls'group.
Thank you very much!
